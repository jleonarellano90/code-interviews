/* An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operates on a strictly
 * "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest"
 * (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select
 * whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest
 * animal of that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would
 * like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement
 * operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You
 * may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
