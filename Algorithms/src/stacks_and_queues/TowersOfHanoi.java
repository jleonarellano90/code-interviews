/* In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N
 * disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts
 * with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each
 * disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following
 * constraints:
 *
 * (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next rod.
 * (3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
 *
 * Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using
 * Stacks.
