/* The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
 *
 * The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red
 * (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or blue (B). For example, the computer might
 * have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).
 *
 * You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example,
 * guess YRGB.
 *
 * When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit". If
 * you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a
 * "pseudo-hit". Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a 
 * pseudo-hit.
 *
 * For example, if the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have
 * one hit and one pseudo-hit.
 *
 * Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, returns the number of
 * hits and pseudo-hits.
